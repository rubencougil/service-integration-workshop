# Turn `Order` into an event-sourced aggregate

- Make the entity implement `EventSourcedAggregate` and make it `use` the `EventSourcedAggregateCapabilities` trait.
- Fix `OrderTest` (remote the call to `markTestIncomplete` first, run the tests using `./run-tests.sh`).
- Instead of using `Database` to persist `Order` instances, use the "event-sourced aggregate repository" returned by `Application::orderRepository()`.
- Move the code for sending an email to the event listener method `Application::whenOrderPlaced`. The order repository is already configured to dispatch events from the `Order` aggregate and call this method (see also the factory methods `Application::orderRepository()` and `Application::eventDispatcher()`).
- To see if the email has been sent, open Mailcatcher: [`localhost:1080`](http://localhost:1080).
