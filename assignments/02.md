# Introduce versioning and schema definitions for `PlaceOrder`

- Define a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) for `PlaceOrder` version 1.
- Validate the JSON data in the consumer according to the schema. Use the pre-installed [`json-schema` library](https://github.com/justinrainbow/json-schema/).
- Bonus assignment: expose the schema to clients of this service by adding a new controller to `Application` that serves the JSON schema itself.
