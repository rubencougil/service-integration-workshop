# Create a local read model for conferences in `conference_web`

- When a new conferences gets "created" in the `conference_management` service, it should notify other services by publishing a new type of message.
- `ConferenceWeb` should have its own consumer, consuming such event messages, building up a local read model to be used instead of querying `conference_management` all the time.
- Use [Redis](https://redis.io/commands) to store the read models. Here are some examples which use the pre-installed [`predis` library](https://github.com/nrk/predis):

    ```php 
    $redis = new Client([
        'host' => 'redis'
    ]);

    $projection = new \stdClass();
    $projection->id = $eventData->id;
    $projection->name = $eventData->name;
    
    // store the initial projection
    $redis->hset(
        'conferences',
        $projection->id,
        json_encode($projection)
    );
    
    // load projection by ID
    $projection = json_decode(
        $redis->hget('conferences', $eventData->id)
    );
    
    // load all projections
    $projections = array_map('json_decode', $redis->hgetall('conferences'));
    ```

- Open the Redis Browser at [`localhost:8079`](http://localhost:8079/) to find out what's inside the Redis database.
