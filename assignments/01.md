# Migrate from a synchronous to an asynchronous integration style

- Use RabbitMQ.
- Publish messages using `Exchange::publish()` (note that you **don't need to serialize** the data yourself before passing it to this function).
- Consume messages in `src/OrdersAndRegistrations/consume.php`.
- Keep an eye on the logs:

    ```
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

- Restart the consumer whenever you change its code:

    ```
    docker-compose restart orders_and_registrations
    ```

- Take a look at the RabbitMQ management UI to find out what's going on behind the scenes: [localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672/).
